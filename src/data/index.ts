    description:
      'Serverless applications are gaining momentum. Developers like the simplicity of writing a serverless function. And with WebAssembly as an underlying technology, it is fast and easy to build WebAssembly serverless apps.  In this talk, Rajat and Matt introduce Spin, an open source tool for rapidly building serverless functions in WebAssembly. We’ll start by talking about WebAssembly itself and why a technology that was good for the browser is great for the cloud. Then we will look at how Spin works. To illustrate this, we’ll talk about the `goodfirstissue` bot and demo how with minimal changes, we are able to run this bot as serverless app using Spin',

We will begin with an introduction to blockchain nodes (servers), what they are, and a brief description of how they work, including the differences between each blockchain. Once the basics are covered, we will discuss the challenges of running a node blockchain on a server.   Next, we will explore how to leverage k8s to solve some of the challenges of hosting nodes. This will include describing how to deploy nodes on k8s using statefulsets, updating blockchains, and accessing blockchain data using k8s services.   Finally, we will cover how to monitor nodes using Prometheus.',

    title: 'How & Why Does The Work of OpenSSF Impact You',
    description:
      "Open Source Software is in use by a large number of organizations for whom security and compliance is paramount. Examples of these are governments, banks, financial institutions, etc. These large organizations are raising questions about the integrity of software artifacts and establish provenance at each stage. Recent evidence of which can be found here:   [1] https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-161r1.pdf [2] https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/  Many projects are positioned to provide some answers using Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs) and implementing initiatives such as SLSA.dev, However there is massive inconsistency across the organizations' repositories, working groups (and other administrative entities).   Secure Open Source Supply Chains are paramount to those involved in creating and distributing open source software. Those engineers, engineering managers, and program managers who are responsible for delivering software that is or consumes open source software are under increasing scrutiny to establish provenance of their software artifacts.   This talk will demonstrate the impact of the work OpenSSF is doing ― especially for open source foundations, by sharing details about how we are embracing best practices prescribed by OpenSSF. The talk will also contain some ideas about how we intend to further securing our open source ecosystem.",

    description:
      "Much like the game Among Us, Bad faith actors can sneak into our spaceship aka containerized workloads anytime. It now comes to the crew members to guess and eliminate the threat.  Similarly even if we secure our supply chain, there will always be threat actors that can attack at runtime. It is not a matter of if but when. There's a need to enforce security at runtime to contain damages when it happens.  Containers are not black boxes, there's a need to understand the entities that run inside them. Just sand-boxing around them isn't enough, we need to profile our entities inside our containers, profile them and enforce zero trust rules.  But achieving zero trust is non trivial especially with the highly dynamic nature of modern containerized workloads.  This session will be about understanding the entities inside our containers, trying to identify assets that are exposed to entities inside containers, explore our crew members eBPF, Seccomp and LSMs who will help us identify and quarantine breaches at runtime minimizing our attack surface in the process.",

Join him on a ride to learn about the history, the different types of scaling techniques, and finally go through a live demo of scraping metrics from Prometheus using the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit and scaling the workloads using HorizontalPodAutoscalar. Being an active contributor for Keptn, He will briefly explain how the Keptn Metrics Operator enables us to have a single entry point for the metrics data, regardless of the source of metrics and helps us in autoscaling our workloads. Get to learn about the challenges faced while scaling workloads manually. Get to learn about the benefits of using metrics to autoscale Kubernetes workloads without having to fear unessential costs and poor application performance. Get hands-on experience using the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit to scrape metrics from any metric provider and then use it to autoscale your Kubernetes workloads.',

In this session, I'll explain intuitively how these agents work and how anyone can quickly create customized bots using open-source tools like LangChain and models like Dolly, and those by Stability AI which were just launched. The biggest pain that we see right now is in deploying these apps which run well locally and are easy to set up but might need many additional steps to make them production ready. Kubernetes is an important tool in enabling the deployment and maintenance of these next-generation apps and we'll see how pipelines can be designed for it.  We would also cover the concept of vector stores that enable fast searching and for providing memory to the agent, and how they can be deployed on Kubernetes to be used for agents in production.",

Supply chain security is even more critical when it comes to Kubernetes & cloud-native landscape because many tools and applications from different vendors and communities come together, significantly increasing the sources of potential supply chain attacks.\nIn this session, I will provide a quick introduction to supply chain security, what risks we face at various stages (code, build, deploy etc) of the supply chain, what kind of supply chain attacks we have seen in the recent past and what common step an organisation can take to ensure its supply chain is robust and less prone to attacks. I will also discuss the cultural changes an organisation should make to ensure effective collaboration between owners of different supply chain stages of a product and will also touch upon the Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA).',

    description:
      'Cloud-native applications comprise various components including data services, storage systems, and related Kubernetes objects. Each component requires its own data protection tools, strategy, and domain expertise. A robust solution aligned with business requirements often involves complex workflows. What if there was a way to coordinate the implementation of these workflows while optimizing how backups are moved into storage?   During this talk, Amruta will demonstrate how two open-source tools, Kanister and Kopia, work together to optimize backup and recovery for Kubernetes applications.    2. Benefits to the Ecosystem  Robust and scalable backup and recovery workflows are among the key operational concerns that teams need to address. But their complexity inhibits developers from running databases in Kubernetes, despite the rising support for stateful applications in the environment.   Kanister not only enables backup and restore of databases in Kubernetes, it allows developers and operators to perform application-specific data management tasks by defining a set of Kubernetes custom resources. Using Kanister and Kopia together, developers can create encrypted, compressed and deduplicated point-in-time snapshots from the streamed database backup and upload them to the cloud object store.',

    title: 'First Principles of Observability Systems',
    description:
      'As Kubernetes and microservice adoption has gone mainstream, a slew of observability solutions have been born, and picking an observability system is hard. A couple of questions you might find yourself asking are: - “Is the ingestion rate fast enough?” - “How long can the system retain data?” - “Are the query speeds good enough?” - “How easy is it to scale horizontally?” Benchmarking systems may or may not always give you the right answer for a variety of reasons- it’s easier to take a decision based on understanding the first principles. All of the observability pillars(metrics, logs, traces, profiling)  share a common set of problems, we’ll look at how various open-source projects have tackled those problems and evaluate their solutions. Hopefully, by end of the talk, it can help you make a decision on an observability system or maybe inspire you to build your own.',

      "Incremental backups in Kubernetes: Where we stand and what's missing",
    description:
      'As Kubernetes adoption matures, a recent CNCF.io study showed that stateful workloads have grown to over 40% of deployments. Operating persistence and storage on a cluster for the stateful applications in Kubernetes has always been challenging, especially when it comes to backup and disaster recovery. The traditional backup strategies are not sufficient considering the dynamic nature of containers and distributed architecture.   In this talk, Prasad will talk about different strategies used to protect Kubernetes stateful application data and compare their pros and cons. We will also throw light on the missing piece in Kubernetes architecture to perform incremental backups i.e. changed block tracking. And ongoing efforts by Data Protection Working Group to add the changed block tracking capability to Kubernetes with KEP-3314 to make the backups more efficient and quicker.',

    description:
      'CloudNativePG is an open source operator designed to manage PostgreSQL workloads on any supported Kubernetes cluster running in private, public, hybrid, or multi-cloud environments. CloudNativePG adheres to DevOps principles and concepts such as declarative configuration and immutable infrastructure.  It defines a new Kubernetes resource called Cluster representing a PostgreSQL cluster made up of a single primary and an optional number of replicas that co-exist in a chosen Kubernetes namespace for High Availability and offloading of read-only queries.  Applications that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster can access the PostgreSQL database using a service which is solely managed by the operator, without having to worry about changes of the primary role following a failover or a switchover. Applications that reside outside the Kubernetes cluster, need to configure a Service or Ingress object to expose the Postgres via TCP. Web applications can take advantage of the native connection pooler based on PgBouncer.  We will cover Day 0 to Day 2 Operations and How data on Kubernetes is more important these days. Talk will cover about  Day 0: Planning Day 1: Setup and validate. Day2 : Day2 operations Like Restore and Scaling.',

    title: 'How to Not-Mess-Up Production',
    description:
      'Deploying applications from localhost to production can be a daunting task. There are a million ways to break it and give the on-call team a new topic for the engineering blog.  Seemingly small things (chmod) can cause big impacts (crash the server beyond recovery). In this talk, Wilfred shares his experiences of production mess-ups  Here’s what Wilfred has in store for you: Discover how running "chmod root" during a business meeting led to a server crash beyond recovery and an awkward conversation with the boss. Learn why you should never ever run "select *", unless you have all day to wait for the results to come in. Find out what happens when you accidentally make your secrets public, and how to avoid doing so in the future. Explore the joys of "chmod /usr" and the broken sudo nightmares that follow. Get practical tips on how to avoid production mistakes, and how to handle them when they happen.  This talk will take into consideration a practical deployment scenario of deploying a backend system on a VM with a database(crash this and data gone) and walk you over what you want to do, what you\'ll do, what problems you\'ll face, and how it can mess up production.  You\'ll learn why production is stringent the way it is and the importance of mechanisms like IAM, RBAC, ABAC, MFA.  The final take will be on what to do when you or someone along you messes up something in production. Join in to learn from Wilfred’s experiences of making on localhost and breaking on production.',

    description:
      'NGINX is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.\n\nIn this session, we will cover Nginx Ingress Controller capabilities. How you can increase uptime and improve performance, preventing connection timeouts and errors, with advanced Layer 7 (HTTP) and Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancing across Kubernetes pods with dynamic, non-disruptive adaptation to topology changes, session persistence, and health checks. Avoid downtime with blue-green, canary and rate limiting connectivity management patterns.',
